# üß† Alzheimer's Disease Prevalence Analysis

**Type:** Health Data Analysis  
**Tools:** SQL, Excel, Data Visualization  
**Year:** 2024

## üìå Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Alzheimer's disease prevalence using multidimensional public health data. It explores geographic, demographic, and health-related patterns to support informed public health planning, awareness, and intervention.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Alzheimer's disease is a growing global health challenge. To support prevention and care, we analyzed available data to answer:

- Where is Alzheimer‚Äôs most prevalent?
- Who is most at risk?
- What related health patterns can be observed?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Skills
- **SQL** ‚Äì Data querying and aggregation  
- **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Standardized and validated health records  
- **Trend Analysis** ‚Äì Temporal and regional patterns  
- **Insight Generation** ‚Äì Key findings & public health implications  
- **Health Stratification** ‚Äì Age, gender, ethnicity, co-occurring conditions  
- **Report Writing** ‚Äì Visual and written deliverables

## üìä Key Insights
- **Age & Gender**: Most common in those 65+, especially females  
- **Ethnicity**: Higher prevalence in Hispanic populations  
- **Geography**: U.S., DC, and Territories had highest rates  
- **Comorbidities**: Strong association with depression, smoking, high blood sugar (non-diabetic)  
- **Caregiving**: High burden on family and friends

## üí° Recommendations
- Targeted awareness for older adults and high-risk groups  
- Gender-specific support and caregiver services  
- Integrated mental health services  
- Promotion of healthy lifestyle changes  
- Improve regional data collection and reporting

## ‚úÖ Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset  
- Insight report with visualizations  
- Written documentation  
- Strategic recommendations  

## üìö What I Learned
This project improved my ability to:
- Work with stratified health data  
- Derive actionable insights from complex datasets  
- Communicate data-driven findings clearly  




# Alzheimer's Disease: A Comprehensive Analysis


![](image_back.jpg)

## About
This documentation provides a detailed analysis of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease using a comprehensive dataset. The analysis includes geographic, temporal, data source, data type, confidence intervals, stratification, topic, class, and general data overview. The goal is to provide insights into the distribution and trends of Alzheimer's disease prevalence across various dimensions.

## Problem Statement
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Understanding its prevalence across different geographies, demographics, and time periods is crucial for public health planning and resource allocation. This documentation aims to analyze the available data to uncover patterns and trends in Alzheimer's disease prevalence, providing valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.

## Skills Applied
- SQL
- Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Data Interpretation
- Trend Analysis

## Insights
Through this analysis, the following insights were uncovered;
- Alzheimer's is most common in individuals aged 65 and older and is particularly prevalent among the Hispanic population.
- The disease is more prevalent in the United States, DC, and Territories, with a notable correlation between higher prevalence rates and wider confidence intervals.
- Females are more affected by Alzheimer's compared to males.
- There is a significant caregiving burden, with many patients receiving extensive care from friends or family members.
- A substantial number of patients have experienced cognitive decline or memory loss recently.
- Many patients with Alzheimer's also report high blood sugar levels (without diabetes) and have a history of smoking.
- Depression is a common comorbidity among Alzheimer's patients.

## Recommendations
- Targeted Awareness and Screening: Focus on older adults, Hispanics, and high-prevalence areas for early detection and intervention.
- Support for Caregivers: Enhance resources and support systems for informal caregivers.
- Gender-Specific Strategies: Develop healthcare strategies and research initiatives tailored to the needs of women.
- Mental Health Integration: Incorporate mental health services into Alzheimer's care to address the high incidence of depression.
- Lifestyle Interventions: Promote healthy lifestyle changes to manage risk factors such as high blood sugar and smoking.
- Improved Data Collection: Enhance precision in data reporting to better understand regional variability and target public health strategies effectively.




## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, offering valuable insights into its distribution across various geographic locations, time periods, data sources, and demographic categories. The findings can aid in better understanding and addressing the public health challenges posed by Alzheimer's disease, contributing to more informed decision-making and resource allocation. Through this documentation, we have demonstrated the ability to handle complex datasets, perform detailed analysis, and present the results in a clear and meaningful way.
