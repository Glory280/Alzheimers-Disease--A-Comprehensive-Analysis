## About
This documentation provides a detailed analysis of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease using a comprehensive dataset. The analysis includes geographic, temporal, data source, data type, confidence intervals, stratification, topic, class, and general data overview. The goal is to provide insights into the distribution and trends of Alzheimer's disease prevalence across various dimensions.

**Type:** Health Data Analysis  
**Tools:** SQL, Excel, Data Visualization  
**Year:** 2024

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Alzheimer's disease prevalence using multidimensional public health data. It explores geographic, demographic, and health-related patterns to support informed public health planning, awareness, and intervention.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Alzheimer's disease is a growing global health challenge. To support prevention and care, we analyzed available data to answer:

- Where is Alzheimer’s most prevalent?
- Who is most at risk?
- What related health patterns can be observed?

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **SQL** – Data querying and aggregation  
- **Data Cleaning** – Standardized and validated health records  
- **Trend Analysis** – Temporal and regional patterns  
- **Insight Generation** – Key findings & public health implications  
- **Health Stratification** – Age, gender, ethnicity, co-occurring conditions  
- **Report Writing** – Visual and written deliverables

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Age & Gender**: Most common in those 65+, especially females  
- **Ethnicity**: Higher prevalence in Hispanic populations  
- **Geography**: U.S., DC, and Territories had highest rates  
- **Comorbidities**: Strong association with depression, smoking, high blood sugar (non-diabetic)  
- **Caregiving**: High burden on family and friends

## 💡 Recommendations
- Targeted awareness for older adults and high-risk groups  
- Gender-specific support and caregiver services  
- Integrated mental health services  
- Promotion of healthy lifestyle changes  
- Improve regional data collection and reporting

## ✅ Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset  
- Insight report with visualizations  
- Written documentation  
- Strategic recommendations  

## 📚 What I Learned
This project improved my ability to:
- Work with stratified health data  
- Derive actionable insights from complex datasets  
- Communicate data-driven findings clearly  





## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, offering valuable insights into its distribution across various geographic locations, time periods, data sources, and demographic categories. The findings can aid in better understanding and addressing the public health challenges posed by Alzheimer's disease, contributing to more informed decision-making and resource allocation. Through this documentation, we have demonstrated the ability to handle complex datasets, perform detailed analysis, and present the results in a clear and meaningful way.
